# Principal Propagation Setup

Authenticate each MCP user to SAP with their own identity via BTP Destination Service and Cloud Connector. No shared SAP passwords. Full per-user audit trail.

## When to Use

- Enterprise environments requiring per-user SAP authorization
- Compliance/audit requirements (who did what in SAP)
- When different users should have different SAP permissions
- Zero shared credentials architecture

## Architecture

```
MCP Client (JWT)
  │
  ▼
ARC-1 (/mcp)
  │  validates JWT (OIDC or XSUAA)
  │  passes X-User-Token to Destination Service
  ▼
BTP Destination Service
  │  resolves per-user destination (PrincipalPropagation type)
  ▼
Connectivity Proxy
  │
  ▼
Cloud Connector
  │  propagates user identity via client certificate
  ▼
SAP ICM
  │  CERTRULE / VUSREXTID maps certificate to SAP user
  ▼
SAP user session (per-user)
```

## Prerequisites

- JWT-based MCP auth working ([OIDC setup](oauth-jwt-setup.md) or [XSUAA setup](xsuaa-setup.md))
- ARC-1 deployed on BTP Cloud Foundry
- Destination + Connectivity service instances bound to ARC-1 app
- Cloud Connector connected to your BTP subaccount
- SAP system reachable from Cloud Connector

## Step 1: Create Two BTP Destinations

Create a dual-destination setup in BTP Cockpit (Connectivity → Destinations):

### Shared destination (fallback)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Name | `SAP_TRIAL` (your choice) |
| Type | HTTP |
| URL | `http://<sap-host>:<sap-port>` |
| Authentication | BasicAuthentication |
| User | Technical SAP user |
| Password | Technical SAP password |

### Per-user destination (principal propagation)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Name | `SAP_TRIAL_PP` (your choice) |
| Type | HTTP |
| URL | `http://<sap-host>:<sap-port>` |
| Authentication | PrincipalPropagation |

## Step 2: Configure Cloud Connector

1. Open Cloud Connector Admin UI
2. Add the SAP system mapping (Cloud to On-Premise → Add)
3. Enable **Principal Propagation** in the access control for the mapping
4. Configure the system certificate for signing principal propagation certificates

### Required Cloud Connector Resource Paths

If you use restrictive Cloud Connector resource whitelisting, expose at least these paths:

| URL Path | Access Policy | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `/sap/bc/adt` | Path and all sub-paths | ADT API used by ARC-1 core read/write operations |
| `/sap/opu/odata/UI2/PAGE_BUILDER_CUST` | Path and all sub-paths | FLP launchpad management via `SAPManage` FLP actions |
| `/sap/opu/odata/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY_SRV` | Path and all sub-paths | UI5 ABAP Repository OData (BSP deploy metadata) |

The trial setup guide uses `/` (all paths), which implicitly includes these routes. For production, explicit path allowlists are recommended for defense in depth.

## Step 3: Configure SAP System

The SAP system must trust Cloud Connector's certificates and map them to SAP users.

### Certificate trust (STRUST)

1. Import the Cloud Connector system certificate into STRUST (SSL Server Standard PSE → Certificate List)

### Certificate mapping (CERTRULE or VUSREXTID)

Configure how the certificate's subject is mapped to a SAP user:

- **CERTRULE** (transaction `/nCERTRULE`): Rule-based mapping (e.g., Subject CN → SAP User ID)
- **VUSREXTID** (table `VUSREXTID` via SM30): Explicit user-to-certificate subject mapping

### ICM parameters

Verify these profile parameters (transaction `/nRZ10`):

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `icm/HTTPS/verify_client` | `1` | Accept client certificates |
| `login/certificate_mapping_rulebased` | `1` | Enable CERTRULE mapping |

## Step 4: Configure ARC-1

```bash
export SAP_BTP_DESTINATION=SAP_TRIAL
export SAP_BTP_PP_DESTINATION=SAP_TRIAL_PP
export SAP_PP_ENABLED=true
```

### Behavior

- **JWT request** → ARC-1 uses the per-user destination (`SAP_BTP_PP_DESTINATION`), passing the JWT as `X-User-Token`
- **PP failure + `SAP_PP_STRICT=false`** (default) → falls back to shared destination
- **PP failure + `SAP_PP_STRICT=true`** → returns error, no fallback
- **API key / non-JWT request** → uses shared destination

### All PP-related config

| Flag | Env Var | Default | Description |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `--pp-enabled` | `SAP_PP_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable principal propagation |
| `--pp-strict` | `SAP_PP_STRICT` | `false` | Fail on PP errors (no fallback) |
| — | `SAP_BTP_DESTINATION` | — | Shared (fallback) destination name |
| — | `SAP_BTP_PP_DESTINATION` | — | Per-user PP destination name |

## Step 5: Test

1. **Check logs** after a JWT-authenticated request:
   ```bash
   cf logs arc1-mcp-server --recent | grep -E "Principal propagation|per-user|BTP destination"
   ```

2. **Check SAP** for per-user identity:
   - Transaction `SM20` (security audit log) — verify the individual SAP user appears
   - Transaction `SM04` (user sessions) — check for per-user sessions

## Troubleshooting

### PP always falls back to shared user

1. Verify `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true` is set
2. Verify `SAP_BTP_PP_DESTINATION` authentication type is `PrincipalPropagation` in BTP Cockpit
3. Check Cloud Connector logs for principal propagation errors
4. Verify the JWT contains a valid user identity

### SAP returns 401 for propagated user

1. **Check STRUST:** Is the Cloud Connector system cert in the certificate list?
2. **Check ICM:** Is `icm/HTTPS/verify_client = 1`?
3. **Check certificate mapping:** Does CERTRULE or VUSREXTID map the certificate subject to a valid SAP user?
4. **Check user exists:** Does the SAP user exist and is it unlocked?

### Cloud Connector issues

1. Check Cloud Connector logs (All/Payload trace)
2. Verify `icm/trusted_reverse_proxy` parameter matches Cloud Connector system certificate
3. Ensure principal propagation is enabled in Cloud Connector access control

## What's NOT supported

ARC-1 does **not** support local ephemeral X.509 certificate generation. The following flags do not exist:

- `--pp-ca-key`, `--pp-ca-cert`, `--pp-cert-ttl`
- `--client-cert`, `--client-key`
- `--oidc-username-claim`, `--oidc-user-mapping`

Principal propagation is exclusively via BTP Destination Service + Cloud Connector.
