# SAP ABAP Platform Trial 2023 — Self-Hosted Setup Guide

This document describes how to run the SAP ABAP Platform Trial 2023 Docker
container on a Linux server (e.g. Hetzner Cloud), configure it for ADT access,
connect it to SAP BTP via Cloud Connector, and wire up the integration test
suite and GitHub Actions CI.

> **Security note:** This guide intentionally omits the server IP/hostname.
> Never commit connection URLs, credentials, or license keys to the repository.

**Traffic flows:**

| Use case | Path |
|----------|------|
| ADT / integration tests | `https://<host>` → nginx:443 → ABAP:50000 |
| CC admin panel | `https://<host>:8443` → nginx:8443 → CC:8443 |
| BTP → on-premises ABAP | BTP Connectivity → CC tunnel → `localhost:50000` |

The Cloud Connector is included in the `sapse/abap-cloud-developer-trial:2023`
image and runs as a separate Java process inside the same container.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux server with at least **16 GB RAM**, **4 CPU cores**, and **150 GB
  disk** (the SAP container image is ~80 GB compressed).
- Docker (or Podman) installed.
- Root or `sudo` access on the server.
- A DNS A record pointing a subdomain at the server IP (for HTTPS).
- A SAP license file for your hardware key (obtain from the SAP trial portal).

---

## Server Setup

### Install Docker

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
apt-get update
apt-get install -y docker.io
systemctl enable --now docker
```

### Verify disk space

The SAP image is large. Confirm there is sufficient space before pulling:

```bash
df -h /var/lib/docker
```

---

## SAP ABAP Trial Container

### Pulling the Image

The official SAP ABAP Cloud Developer Trial image is available from Docker Hub
under the `sapse` organisation:

```bash
docker pull sapse/abap-cloud-developer-trial:2023
```

> **Note:** `podman` can be used as a drop-in replacement. If you get a disk-
> full error from podman's `/var/tmp` overlay, ensure the underlying partition
> has enough space or reconfigure the podman storage driver.

### Starting the Container

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name a4h \
  --hostname vhcala4hci \
  -p 50000:50000 \
  -p 50001:50001 \
  -p 8443:8443 \
  -p 30213:30213 \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="40000 60999" \
  --sysctl kernel.shmmax=21474836480 \
  --sysctl kernel.shmmni=32768 \
  --sysctl kernel.shmall=5242880 \
  -v /data/sap/sysvol:/sysvol \
  sapse/abap-cloud-developer-trial:2023
```

Key parameters:

| Parameter | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `--hostname vhcala4hci` | SAP requires a specific hostname |
| `-p 50000:50000` | SAP ICM HTTP port (ADT, browser access) |
| `-p 50001:50001` | SAP ICM HTTPS port |
| `-p 8443:8443` | Alternative HTTPS |
| `-p 30213:30213` | HANA SQL port (multitenant tenant DB) |
| `--sysctl ...` | Required kernel parameters for SAP/HANA |
| `-v /data/sap/sysvol:/sysvol` | Persistent volume for SAP data |

### Disk Space Warning

If you see:
```
Error: copying file write /var/tmp/podman934593548: no space left on device
```
This means the partition hosting `/var/tmp` or the podman overlay is full.
Either free space or move Docker/Podman storage to a larger partition.

### Verifying the Container is Up

The SAP system takes 5-10 minutes to fully start. Check readiness:

```bash
# Watch SAP startup progress
docker exec a4h /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapcontrol -nr 00 -function GetProcessList

# Quick HTTP ping (expects 403 when SAP is up)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:50000/sap/bc/ping
```

SAP is ready when `sapcontrol GetProcessList` shows all processes as **Running**.

---

## SAP System Configuration

### License Installation

The trial image ships without a permanent license. Obtain a permanent license
from the SAP trial portal for your hardware key.

**Find your hardware key:**

```bash
docker exec a4h /usr/sap/A4H/SYS/exe/run/saplikey \
  pf=/usr/sap/A4H/SYS/profile/A4H_D00_vhcala4hci \
  -get
```

Note the `Hardware Key` from the output and request a license file from the
SAP trial portal.

**Install the license:**

```bash
# Copy license file into container
docker cp /path/to/A4H_license.txt a4h:/tmp/A4H_license.txt

# Install all keys from the file
docker exec a4h /usr/sap/A4H/SYS/exe/run/saplikey \
  pf=/usr/sap/A4H/SYS/profile/A4H_D00_vhcala4hci \
  -install /tmp/A4H_license.txt

# Verify installation
docker exec a4h /usr/sap/A4H/SYS/exe/run/saplikey \
  pf=/usr/sap/A4H/SYS/profile/A4H_D00_vhcala4hci \
  -get
```

The correct profile path inside the container is:
```
/usr/sap/A4H/SYS/profile/A4H_D00_vhcala4hci
```

> **Common mistake:** The profile is `A4H_D00_vhcala4hci`, not
> `A4H_DVEBMGS00_vhcala4hci`. List `ls /usr/sap/A4H/SYS/profile/` to confirm
> the correct filename if `saplikey` reports a missing profile error.

### Work Process Tuning

The default SAP profile only allocates **7 dialog work processes**. Running the
full integration test suite (34 tests) exhausts these quickly and causes 503
errors. Increase them:

**Edit the instance profile inside the container:**

```bash
docker exec -it a4h bash
vi /usr/sap/A4H/SYS/profile/A4H_D00_vhcala4hci
```

Change:
```
rdisp/wp_no_dia = 7
```
To:
```
rdisp/wp_no_dia = 25
rdisp/wp_no_btc = 5
rdisp/wp_no_vb  = 1
```

### Session Timeout Tuning

ADT CRUD operations open stateful sessions (locks) that hold a dialog work
process in **PRIV** (private) mode. If the client disconnects without explicitly
ending the session, the WP stays occupied until the timeout expires.

The default timeout is 600 seconds (10 minutes), which means 30+ integration
tests can exhaust all work processes before the first sessions expire.

**Add these parameters to the instance profile:**

```
# Aggressive session cleanup for CI / remote ADT clients
rdisp/plugin_auto_logout = 120
rdisp/max_wprun_time = 300
icm/keep_alive_timeout = 60
http/security_session_timeout = 120
```

| Parameter | Value | Effect |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| `rdisp/plugin_auto_logout` | 120 | Auto-logout idle HTTP plugin sessions after 2 min |
| `rdisp/max_wprun_time` | 300 | Max runtime for a single dialog step (5 min) |
| `icm/keep_alive_timeout` | 60 | Close idle HTTP keep-alive connections after 1 min |
| `http/security_session_timeout` | 120 | HTTP security session timeout (2 min) |

Without these settings, stale PRIV sessions from failed or disconnected tests
accumulate and cause 503 errors for subsequent requests.

**Restart the ABAP application server (not the whole container):**

```bash
# Stop ABAP only
docker exec a4h /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapcontrol -nr 00 -function Stop
# Wait ~60s for full stop
docker exec a4h /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapcontrol -nr 00 -function Start
```

> **Note:** `RestartInstance` did not work reliably; use explicit `Stop` then
> `Start`.

### User Access

The trial system ships with these pre-configured users:

| User | Default Password | Role |
|------|-----------------|------|
| `DEVELOPER` | `ABAPtr2023#00` | ABAP developer (S_DEVELOP auth) |
| `DDIC` | `ABAPtr2023#00` | Data dictionary admin |
| `BWDEVELOPER` | `ABAPtr2023#00` | BW developer |

**Use `DEVELOPER` for ADT and integration tests.** `DDIC` does not have the
`S_DEVELOP` authorization object required to create/edit ABAP objects via ADT.

### Unlocking the DEVELOPER User

After many failed login attempts, the `DEVELOPER` user gets locked
(`UFLAG = 128` in `USR02`). This manifests as HTTP 401 from ADT endpoints even
though `/sap/bc/ping` returns 403 (ping uses a lighter auth check).

**Unlock via HANA SQL (no HANA SYSTEM password required):**

The `a4hadm` OS user has a pre-configured HANA userstore key that connects as
the ABAP schema owner (`SAPA4H`):

```bash
docker exec -it a4h bash
su - a4hadm

# Connect to the HANA tenant DB as SAPA4H
hdbsql -U DEFAULT -d HDB

# Unlock DEVELOPER
UPDATE SAPA4H.USR02 SET UFLAG = 0 WHERE BNAME = 'DEVELOPER';

# Verify
SELECT BNAME, UFLAG, PWDSTATE FROM SAPA4H.USR02
  WHERE BNAME IN ('DEVELOPER', 'DDIC');
\q
```

`UFLAG = 0` means unlocked. `UFLAG = 128` means locked by too many failed
logon attempts. `PWDSTATE = 1` means the user must change password on next
login (leave as-is; ADT handles this transparently).

> **Alternative:** If you have access to SAP GUI or ABAP Developer Tools,
> use transaction `SU01` to unlock users without direct HANA access.

## HTTPS / Reverse Proxy Setup

Expose the SAP system over HTTPS via Nginx and Let's Encrypt.

### Install Nginx and Certbot

```bash
apt-get install -y nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

### Configure Nginx Reverse Proxy

Create `/etc/nginx/sites-available/<your-subdomain>`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <your-subdomain>;

    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://localhost:50000;
        proxy_set_header   Host              $host;
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_read_timeout 300s;
        proxy_send_timeout 300s;
        client_max_body_size 50m;
    }
}
```

Enable the site:

```bash
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<your-subdomain> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx
```

### Obtain Let's Encrypt Certificate

```bash
certbot --nginx -d <your-subdomain>
```

Certbot will automatically update the Nginx config with SSL settings and set
up auto-renewal via a systemd timer.

> **DNS propagation:** Run certbot only after the DNS A record has propagated
> (verify with `dig <your-subdomain>`). Let's Encrypt will fail with a challenge
> error if the record hasn't propagated yet.

---

## Cloud Connector Setup

SAP Cloud Connector (CC) is bundled with the `sapse/abap-cloud-developer-trial:2023`
image. It allows BTP services (Connectivity, Destination) to reach the
on-premises ABAP system through an outbound tunnel — no inbound firewall rules
needed.

### Starting Cloud Connector

CC is not started automatically when the Docker container boots. Start it once
after the container is up:

```bash
docker exec a4h bash -c "rcscc_daemon start"
```

CC logs to `/opt/sap/scc/scc_daemon.log` inside the container and listens on
`https://vhcala4hci:8443` (the container's hostname). To verify it started:

```bash
docker exec a4h curl -sk https://localhost:8443/index.jsp | grep -i "title"
```

> **Note:** CC does not automatically restart when the container restarts.
> Add the `rcscc_daemon start` call to your container startup script or
> run it manually after each container restart.

### Nginx HTTPS Proxy for CC Admin

The CC admin UI is served over HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. Browsers
block XHR calls to self-signed certificates even after clicking "proceed", which
breaks the CC admin panel's JavaScript entirely.

The fix is an nginx HTTPS-to-HTTPS reverse proxy: nginx terminates TLS with the
trusted Let's Encrypt certificate and forwards requests to CC's self-signed
backend with `proxy_ssl_verify off`. The browser sees the trusted cert; CC
still handles authentication internally.

Add this server block to your nginx site config
(`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/<your-subdomain>`):

```nginx
server {
    listen 8443 ssl;
    server_name <your-subdomain>;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/<your-subdomain>/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<your-subdomain>/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass          https://172.17.0.2:8443;
        proxy_ssl_verify    off;
        proxy_set_header    Host              $http_host;
        proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-Proto https;
        proxy_http_version  1.1;
        proxy_set_header    Upgrade           $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header    Connection        "";
        proxy_read_timeout  300s;
        proxy_connect_timeout 75s;
        proxy_buffer_size   128k;
        proxy_buffers       4 256k;
        proxy_busy_buffers_size 256k;
    }
}
```

Open port 8443 in the firewall:

```bash
ufw allow 8443/tcp
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx
```

The CC admin panel is then accessible at `https://<your-subdomain>:8443`.

> **Why not TCP stream pass-through?** A plain TCP proxy (`stream` module)
> forwards CC's self-signed certificate directly to the browser.
> The browser accepts the initial page load after a manual "proceed" click,
> but blocks all subsequent XHR/fetch calls with `ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`.
> The HTTPS reverse proxy solves this completely.

### Initial CC Setup

On first access, CC shows an **Initial Setup** wizard.

1. Navigate to `https://<your-subdomain>:8443` and log in:
   - Username: `Administrator`
   - Password: `manage`
2. You will be prompted to change the password. Set a strong password and save it.
3. On the **Installation Type** screen, select **Master (Primary Installation)**.
4. Complete the wizard. CC saves `<haRole>master</haRole>` in its config.

> **If the wizard does not appear** (CC jumps directly to the dashboard), the
> initial setup was already completed in a previous session.

### Connecting CC to BTP

In the CC admin panel, go to **Define Subaccount → On-Premises to Cloud** and
click **+ Add Subaccount**.

**Step 1 — HTTPS Proxy:** Leave all fields empty (no proxy needed) and click
**Next**.

**Step 2 — BTP Subaccount details:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Region | `cf.us10-001.hana.ondemand.com` |
| Subaccount | Your BTP subaccount GUID (find it in the BTP Cockpit URL or via `btp list accounts/subaccount`) |
| Display Name | Any label, e.g. `dev` |
| Login | Your BTP user (e.g. S-User or email) |
| Password | Your BTP password |

Click **Next**, then **Finish**. CC will establish the outbound tunnel to BTP.
The status dot next to the subaccount turns green when the tunnel is active.

> **BTP Prerequisites:** The BTP subaccount must have the **Connectivity**
> entitlement assigned. The `connectivity/lite` service instance must exist
> in the subaccount before the tunnel can be established. Create it manually
> in the BTP Cockpit (Service Marketplace → Connectivity → Create with plan
> `lite`).

### Adding a System Mapping

Once the subaccount tunnel is active, map the on-premises ABAP system so BTP
can route requests to it.

In the CC admin panel, go to **Cloud to On-Premises** and click **+ Add**.
Walk through the wizard:

| Step | Field | Value |
|------|-------|-------|
| Protocol | Protocol | `HTTP` |
| Back-end Type | Back-end Type | `ABAP System` |
| Internal Host | Internal Host | `localhost` |
| Internal Host | Internal Port | `50000` |
| Virtual Host | Virtual Host | `a4h-abap` |
| Virtual Host | Virtual Port | `50000` |
| Host Header | Host in Request Header | `Use Internal Host` |

> **Virtual Host** is the name BTP uses to refer to this system in
> Destinations. **Internal Host** is the real address as seen from CC inside
> the container. Use `Use Internal Host` for the request header so the ABAP
> system sees `localhost:50000` in the `Host` header, which matches its ICM
> configuration.

Click **Finish**.

### Adding Resources

After saving the system mapping, CC shows it in the list with a warning that no
resources are accessible yet. Click the system mapping row, then click
**+ Add** under **Resources**.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| URL Path | `/` |
| Access Policy | `Path and all sub-paths` |
| Description | `All ADT/OData paths` |

Click **Save**. The system mapping is now fully configured.

### Password Reset

If the CC admin password is lost or the account is locked, reset it directly
in `users.xml` inside the container:

```bash
# Stop CC
docker exec a4h bash -c "rcscc_daemon stop"

# Compute SHA-256 of new password (replace "manage" with your desired password)
NEW_PASS=$(echo -n 'manage' | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}' | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')
echo "Hash: $NEW_PASS"

# Write users.xml with the new password
docker exec a4h bash -c "cat > /opt/sap/scc/config/users.xml << 'EOF'
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<tomcat-users xmlns=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/xml\"
              xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"
              xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/xml tomcat-users.xsd\"
              version=\"1.0\">
  <role rolename=\"admin\"/>
  <group groupname=\"initial\" roles=\"\"/>
  <user username=\"Administrator\" password=\"$NEW_PASS\" groups=\"\" roles=\"admin\"/>
</tomcat-users>
EOF"

# Start CC again
docker exec a4h bash -c "rcscc_daemon start"
```

> **Important:** The `roles="admin"` attribute on the `<user>` element is
> required. If it is missing or set to `roles=""`, Tomcat returns HTTP 408
> on every login attempt. The `groups=""` attribute must also be empty
> (not `groups="initial"`) to avoid inheriting the group's empty role set.

If the CC initial setup needs to be reset as well (not just the password):

```bash
docker exec a4h bash -c "rcscc_daemon stop"
docker exec a4h rm -f /opt/sap/scc/scc_config/scc_config.ini \
                       /opt/sap/scc/scc_config/scc_config.stamp
docker exec a4h bash -c "rcscc_daemon start"
```

This forces the Initial Setup wizard to appear again on next login.

## Integration Tests

### Running Locally

The integration tests are gated by the `integration` build tag and require four
environment variables:

```bash
export SAP_URL=https://<your-subdomain>   # or http://<ip>:50000
export SAP_USER=DEVELOPER
export SAP_PASSWORD='ABAPtr2023#00'
export SAP_CLIENT=001

npm run test:integration
```

The tests:
- Create temporary ABAP objects in the `$TMP` package
- Exercise the full ADT API surface (read, write, activate, unit tests, etc.)
- Clean up all created objects after each test via deferred cleanup functions
- Use the `DEVELOPER` user (not `DDIC` — see [User Access](#user-access))

### Test Categories

The integration test suite covers these areas:

| Category | Tests | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Read operations** | SearchObject, GetProgram, GetClass, GetTable, GetTableContents, RunQuery, GetPackage | Basic ADT read APIs |
| **CDS / RAP** | GetCDSDependencies, GetDDLS, GetBDEF, GetSRVB, GetSource_RAP | CDS views, behavior definitions, service bindings |
| **CRUD** | CRUD_FullWorkflow, LockUnlock, WriteProgram, WriteClass, CreateAndActivateProgram, CreateClassWithTests, EditSource, CreatePackage | Create, lock, modify, activate, delete ABAP objects |
| **Dev tools** | SyntaxCheck, SyntaxCheckWithErrors, RunUnitTests, PrettyPrint, GetPrettyPrinterSettings | Syntax checker, unit test runner, pretty printer |
| **Code intelligence** | CodeCompletion, FindReferences, FindDefinition, GetTypeHierarchy | Code completion, where-used, navigation |
| **RAP E2E** | RAP_E2E_OData | End-to-end: DDLS → SRVD → SRVB → publish |
| **Debugger** | ExternalBreakpoints, DebuggerListener, DebugSessionAPIs | External breakpoints and debug sessions *(skipped in CI)* |
| **Namespaces** | Namespace_GetSource_Class, _Interface, _Program, _Function, _DDLS, _BDEF | Namespaced objects (`/DMO/`, `/UI5/`, `/AIF/`) |

### Skipped Tests

The following tests are automatically skipped in CI and must be run manually:

| Test | Reason | Manual Run Command |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| `TestIntegration_ExternalBreakpoints` | Requires interactive debug session; breakpoint API needs specific user authorization | `npm run test:integration -- --grep ExternalBreakpoints` |
| `TestIntegration_DebuggerListener` | Requires a debuggee (running ABAP program hitting a breakpoint) to catch | `npm run test:integration -- --grep DebuggerListener` |
| `TestIntegration_DebugSessionAPIs` | Tests debug attach/step/stack APIs that need an active debug session | `npm run test:integration -- --grep DebugSessionAPIs` |

These tests are skipped with `t.Skip()` because debugger operations require
interactive sessions that cannot be reliably automated. They still exist in the
test file and can be run manually for local development.

### Known Test Failures

| Test | Status | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `TestIntegration_RAP_E2E_OData` | May FAIL on fresh systems | The test creates a DDLS, SRVD, and SRVB (`ZTEST_MCP_SB_FLIGHT`), then publishes the service binding. The `GetSRVB` verification step may return HTTP 500 immediately after publish due to SAP internal timing. The test retries once after a 3-second delay, but this may still fail on slow systems. On subsequent runs the SRVB already exists, so the test handles the "already exists" error gracefully. |

All other tests should pass on a correctly configured trial system with the
work process and session timeout tuning described above.

### Running a Specific Test

```bash
npm run test:integration -- --grep CRUD_FullWorkflow
```

### Running Tests Without Debugger Tests

To explicitly exclude debugger tests (they are already skipped, but for clarity):

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

## GitHub Actions CI

### Workflow Overview

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/test.yml`:

The integration job only runs when:
- A pull request is opened/updated
- A push lands on `main`
- The workflow is manually dispatched with `run_integration: true`

### GitHub Secrets Setup

Integration tests read credentials from GitHub environment secrets in the
`sap-trial` environment.

**Create the environment:**

```bash
gh api --method PUT repos/<owner>/<repo>/environments/sap-trial
```

**Set the four secrets:**

```bash
gh secret set SAP_URL      --env sap-trial --repo <owner>/<repo> --body "https://<your-subdomain>"
gh secret set SAP_USER     --env sap-trial --repo <owner>/<repo> --body "DEVELOPER"
gh secret set SAP_PASSWORD --env sap-trial --repo <owner>/<repo> --body "ABAPtr2023#00"
gh secret set SAP_CLIENT   --env sap-trial --repo <owner>/<repo> --body "001"
```

**Verify:**

```bash
gh secret list --env sap-trial --repo <owner>/<repo>
```

**Trigger a manual run with integration tests:**

```bash
gh workflow run test.yml --repo <owner>/<repo> --field run_integration=true
```

### CI-Specific Considerations

**Node.js 24 opt-in:** The workflow sets `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true`
at the top level to silence GitHub Actions deprecation warnings about Node.js 20.
The `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-go@v5` actions run on Node.js 20 by
default; this env var forces Node.js 24 ahead of GitHub's mandatory cutover.

**Go module cache disabled:** The workflow uses `cache: false` for
`actions/setup-go` because the Go toolchain download can cause tar extraction
warnings (`/usr/bin/tar: ... Cannot open: File exists`) when the cache is
restored. These warnings are harmless but noisy.

**Test timeout:** Integration tests use `-timeout 10m` to account for network
latency between GitHub Actions runners and the SAP system. Individual ADT calls
from a remote CI runner take longer than from a local machine.

**Debugger tests auto-skip:** The 3 debugger tests (`ExternalBreakpoints`,
`DebuggerListener`, `DebugSessionAPIs`) call `t.Skip()` unconditionally in CI.
They require interactive debug sessions that cannot be automated.

**Session exhaustion prevention:** The SAP system must have the session timeout
tuning from [Session Timeout Tuning](#session-timeout-tuning) applied. Without
it, the 30+ sequential integration tests accumulate stale PRIV sessions on the
SAP server, eventually exhausting all dialog work processes and causing 503
errors for the remaining tests. This is especially pronounced in CI where
network latency is higher and HTTP connections take longer to complete.

## Troubleshooting

### SAP returns 401 on ADT but 403 on `/sap/bc/ping`

The user is locked (`UFLAG=128`). ADT enforces strict auth and rejects locked
users immediately; the lightweight `/sap/bc/ping` service returns 403 (auth
succeeded but no authorisation) for the same locked user.

Fix: [Unlock the DEVELOPER user via HANA SQL](#unlocking-the-developer-user).

### Integration tests fail with 503 mid-run

This is caused by dialog work process exhaustion. Two things must be configured:

1. **Enough work processes:** Set `rdisp/wp_no_dia = 25` (see
   [Work Process Tuning](#work-process-tuning)).
2. **Session timeouts:** Add the session cleanup parameters (see
   [Session Timeout Tuning](#session-timeout-tuning)). Without them, stale
   PRIV sessions from CRUD tests hold work processes for up to 10 minutes.

To diagnose, check the work process table:

```bash
docker exec a4h /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapcontrol -nr 00 -function ABAPGetWPTable
```

Look for DIA work processes in `Stop, PRIV` status — these are held by stale
sessions. If most DIA WPs are PRIV, that explains the 503 errors.

### `saplikey: profile not found`

List the actual profile files:

```bash
ls /usr/sap/A4H/SYS/profile/
```

Use the `A4H_D00_vhcala4hci` file, not `A4H_DVEBMGS00_vhcala4hci`.

### HANA SYSTEM password unknown

Use the `a4hadm` userstore key instead. It connects as `SAPA4H` (the ABAP
schema owner) without needing the SYSTEM password:

```bash
su - a4hadm
hdbsql -U DEFAULT -d HDB
```

### Build fails: TypeScript compilation errors

If you see TypeScript errors during `npm run build`, ensure all dependencies
are installed with `npm ci` and you're using Node.js 20+.

### DDIC user returns 403 on CRUD operations

```
ExceptionResourceNoAuthorization: DDIC is currently editing ZMCP_XXXXX
```

The `DDIC` user does not have the `S_DEVELOP` authorization object. Use the
`DEVELOPER` user for all ADT and integration test operations. See
[User Access](#user-access).

### RAP E2E test fails with "does already exist"

```
Resource Service Binding ZTEST_MCP_SB_FLIGHT does already exist
```

The SRVB was created by a previous test run and not cleaned up. The test now
handles this gracefully by catching the "already exists" error and continuing.
If it still fails, manually delete the object via ADT or SAP GUI (transaction
`SE80`).

### RAP E2E test fails with 500 on GetSRVB after publish

```
status 500 at /sap/bc/adt/businessservices/bindings/ZTEST_MCP_SB_FLIGHT
```

SAP may return HTTP 500 immediately after publishing a service binding. The test
includes a retry with a 3-second delay, but this can still fail on slow systems.
This is a known SAP timing issue and does not indicate a real problem — the SRVB
was created and published successfully.

### Container starts but SAP is not ready after 10 minutes

Check the container logs:

```bash
docker logs a4h --tail 100
```

Look for HANA startup errors. Common causes:
- Insufficient shared memory (`kernel.shmmax` sysctl not set)
- Disk full during HANA startup

### HTTPS certificate errors in integration tests

If using a self-signed cert or testing against HTTP, set:

```bash
export SAP_INSECURE=true
```

or use the plain HTTP URL (`http://server-ip:50000`). Let's Encrypt certificates
do not require `SAP_INSECURE`.

## X.509 Certificate Authentication Setup (mTLS)

This section describes how to configure the SAP trial system for X.509 client
certificate authentication. This is required for testing mTLS and principal
propagation features.

### Generate Test CA and Client Certificate

```bash
# Generate CA (self-signed, for testing only)
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096
openssl req -new -x509 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -days 365 \
  -subj "/CN=arc1-test-ca/O=arc1 testing"

# Generate client certificate for the DEVELOPER user
openssl genrsa -out developer.key 2048
openssl req -new -key developer.key -out developer.csr \
  -subj "/CN=DEVELOPER"
openssl x509 -req -in developer.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key \
  -CAcreateserial -out developer.crt -days 365

# Verify the certificate
openssl x509 -in developer.crt -text -noout | grep Subject
# Expected: Subject: CN = DEVELOPER
```

### Import CA into SAP STRUST

The CA certificate must be added to the SAP system's trust store so it can
verify client certificates signed by this CA.

**Option A: Via SAP GUI (if available)**

1. Open transaction `/nSTRUST`
2. Navigate to **SSL Server Standard** PSE
3. Click **Import** in the Certificate section
4. Paste the content of `ca.crt`
5. Click **Add to Certificate List**
6. Save

**Option B: Via HANA SQL (for headless trial system)**

The trial system may not have SAP GUI access. In this case, use the HANA SQL
approach to insert the certificate directly:

```bash
docker exec -it a4h bash
su - a4hadm

# Copy the CA cert content (base64 encoded)
cat /path/to/ca.crt | base64 -w0

# Use sapgenpse to import (if available)
# Or use the STRUST-related ABAP program via SM38
```

> **Note:** Direct STRUST manipulation via SQL is complex. The recommended approach
> is to use SAP GUI or ADT's STRUST functionality. If you have ADT access from
> Eclipse, you can use the STRUST transaction there.

### Configure SAP Profile for Certificate Login

Edit the instance profile inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it a4h bash
vi /usr/sap/A4H/SYS/profile/A4H_D00_vhcala4hci
```

Add these parameters:

```
# Enable rule-based certificate mapping (allows CERTRULE to work)
login/certificate_mapping_rulebased = 1

# Accept client certificates during TLS handshake
# 0 = don't request, 1 = request (optional), 2 = require
icm/HTTPS/verify_client = 1
```

### Configure Certificate Mapping Rule (CERTRULE)

This tells SAP how to map the certificate's Subject CN to a SAP user.

1. Open transaction `/nCERTRULE` in SAP GUI or ADT
2. Import the client certificate (`developer.crt`)
3. Create a rule:
   - Certificate Attribute: `Subject CN`
   - Login As: `Use CN value as SAP username`
4. Save and activate

### Restart SAP ICM

After profile and CERTRULE changes:

```bash
# Restart ABAP (not the whole container)
docker exec a4h /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapcontrol -nr 00 -function Stop
# Wait ~60s
docker exec a4h /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapcontrol -nr 00 -function Start
```

### Test Certificate Authentication

```bash
# Test with curl (using the HTTPS port)
curl --cert developer.crt --key developer.key \
  --cacert ca.crt \
  "https://<your-subdomain>/sap/bc/adt/core/discovery?sap-client=001"

# Test with arc1
npx arc-1 --url https://<your-subdomain> \
  --client-cert developer.crt \
  --client-key developer.key \
  --ca-cert ca.crt

# If using the trial system's Let's Encrypt cert (no --ca-cert needed):
npx arc-1 --url https://<your-subdomain> \
  --client-cert developer.crt \
  --client-key developer.key
```

> **Important:** The `--ca-cert` flag is for trusting the SAP **server** certificate.
> If your SAP system uses Let's Encrypt (as configured in the HTTPS section above),
> the system's default CA store already trusts it and `--ca-cert` is not needed.
> The client certificate (`--client-cert`) is what SAP uses to authenticate the
> user — these are two different certificates for two different purposes.

### Principal Propagation Test Setup

To test principal propagation (OIDC → ephemeral X.509), the SAP configuration
is the same as above. The CA in STRUST is the same CA that signs the ephemeral
certificates.

```bash
# Test ephemeral cert generation + SAP auth
npx arc-1 --url https://<your-subdomain> \
  --pp-ca-key ca.key \
  --pp-ca-cert ca.crt \
  --oidc-issuer https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0 \
  --oidc-audience api://arc1 \
  --transport http-streamable
```

For full OIDC + principal propagation testing, you also need an EntraID app
registration. See [docs/enterprise-auth.md](enterprise-auth.md) for the
complete setup guide.
